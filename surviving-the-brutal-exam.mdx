Exams are a part and parcel of every student's life, and they often come with their fair share of stress and anxiety. However, some exams can be particularly challenging due to various factors, including the strictness of the examiner. In this blog, I will share my experience of a brutal exam where the examiner's strictness added an extra layer of tension to an already nerve-wracking situation.<br />

**_The Setup_**<br />
It was a bright, sunny morning, and I walked into the examination room with a mix
of anticipation and apprehension. I had studied diligently for weeks, and I was well-prepared
for the subject. However, I had heard rumors about the examiner being notoriously
strict, and that had me a bit on edge.<br />

**_The Atmosphere_**<br />
The atmosphere in the examination room was tense. The desks were neatly arranged,
and there was an eerie silence that hung in the air. As I sat down, I couldn't help
but notice the nervous glances exchanged between my fellow test-takers. We were all
aware of the examiner's reputation, and it was clear that everyone was on their toes.<br />

**_The Examiner's Gaze_**<br />
As the examination papers were distributed, I couldn't help but steal a glance at the examiner. The examiner was a stern-looking individual who appeared to be meticulously scanning the room. Their eagle-eyed gaze seemed to penetrate our souls, and I could feel the pressure intensify.<br />

**_The Strictness Unveiled_**<br />
The moment we began writing, it became evident that the rumors about the examiner's strictness were not unfounded. They meticulously checked every detail, from our identification to the placement of our belongings. Any hint of irregularity, no matter how trivial, was met with a stern reprimand.<br />

During the exam, the silence was palpable. The sound of pens scratching on paper was the only audible noise. It was as though the examiner's strictness had cast a spell on the room, forcing us to concentrate with unwavering intensity.<br />

**_Surviving the Ordeal_**<br />
To survive the ordeal, I focused solely on the exam paper in front of me. I double-checked every answer and ensured my work was neat and organized. I didn't want to give the examiner any reason to scrutinize my paper further. It was a challenging task, but I was determined to make it through.<br />

***The Aftermath***<br />
When the exam finally ended, there was a collective sigh of relief in the room. We had all survived the brutal ordeal. As we left the examination room, we exchanged stories about the various ways in which the examiner had checked and rechecked our work.<br />

**Conclusion**<br />
Exams are inherently stressful, but having a strict examiner can make the experience even more nerve-wracking. My experience taught me the importance of staying focused and composed, no matter how strict the examiner may be. While the exam was brutal, it also served as a valuable lesson in handling pressure and maintaining one's composure in challenging situations. So, if you ever find yourself facing a strict examiner, remember to stay calm, stay focused, and give it your best shot. You might just surprise yourself with how well you can perform under pressure.
